# Important Complexity Concepts

[[Feedback loop]] & Q-R-N

[[Positive reinforcement loop]]

[[Eigenvector]] and [[Eigenvalue]]

[[Power law]] and the more frequent outliers ("Fat" Tail Behavior or the Black Swan)

[[Sigmoid curve]]

[[Self-organising criticality]]

[[Golden ratio]] (phi), the most irrational number

[[Novelty]] vs. [[Familiarity]] ratio (phi:1)
[[Practice]] vs. [[Theory]] ratio (phi:1)

Unsustainable [[Emergence]] (Transient/Collapsing)
Sustainable [[Emergence]] (Stable/Evolutionary)

[[Entropy]] Negentropy and Requisite inefficiency

Interplay between Coherence/Consistancy, [[Experiment]], and [[Knowledge]]

messy coherence in light of persistence over consistency

[[Signal]] vs [[Noise]]

[[Abstraction]] and [[Granularity]] (Also an emerging field - no pun intended - called [[Granular computation]])

[[Attention]] as emergence

[[Directed Acyclic Graph]]

***The Abstraction-Emergence Loop***: Emergence moves from simple rules to complex behavior, while abstraction moves from complex behavior to simple laws. Attention manages this loop by "dialing down" granularity and "dialing up" abstraction, allowing novelty to emerge.

the [[Universe]] does not just "prefer" a [[Flow]] state—it is arguably defined by its pursuit of it. This phenomenon is formally governed by the [[Constructal law]], which states that for any flow system to persist in time, it must evolve in such a way that it provides easier and easier access to its currents.

Exactly. In the "Symmetry Engine" of the scientific method, falsifiability is the mechanism that prevents the flow of knowledge from becoming a "Cycle" and forces it to become an "ADG" (Acyclic Directed Graph).
Without falsifiability, science would be prone to circular reasoning, where a theory is used to prove the data and the data is used to prove the theory. This creates a "Closed Loop" where information swirls but never advances.
